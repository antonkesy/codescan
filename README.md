# CodeScanAI

CodeScanAI utilizes a variety of AI models to scan your codebase for bad development practices. It is currently configured to catch potential security vulnerabilities, but will be extended to other use cases in the future. It leverages powerful LLM models to provide suggestions on ways to improve the security of your codebase from external attacks, unauthorized access, etc. The currently supported AI models include:

- OpenAI,
- Google Gemini, and
- custom self-hosted AI servers.

It has also been designed to enable seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines like GitHub Actions, or can be used via a simple CLI command locally. The idea behind CodeScanAI is to enable developers automatically detect potential security issues in their code throughout the development process.

Check out the detailed [demo and setup](https://github.com/codescan-ai/codescanai-demo) and try it out today!

## Features

- **Flexible Scanning Options:**
  - **Full Directory Scans:** You can perform a comprehensive security analysis by scanning all files within a directory.
  - **Changes Only Scan:** Supports the ability to scan only those files that have changed since the last scan.
  - **PR-Specific Scans:** Only scan the files modified in a specific pull request to optimize the scanning process, reduce overhead and ensure new code changes are up to standard.

- **Support for Multiple AI Models:**

  CodeScanAI provides support for a range of AI models. It currently supports OpenAI, Google Gemini, and self hosted model. Based on user demands, we can add support for other popular AI models like Claude, Grok, etc.

- **CI/CD Integration:**

  - Seamlessly integrate the CLI tool into GitHub Actions for automated security vulnerability scanning on every pull request.
  - Supports targeted scans on specific branches or changes within a repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- API keys for the supported AI models:
  - OpenAI API key, OR
  - Gemini API key, OR
  - Access to a custom AI server (host, port, and optional token)
- Set an environment variable for your API key(s).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'

export GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your_gemini_api_key'
```

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install via pip

You can install the tool directly from the repository using pip:

```bash
pip install codescanai
```

This will allow you to use the `codescanai` command directly in your terminal.

#### Option 2: Clone the Repository

If you prefer to clone the repository and install the dependencies manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codescan-ai/codescan.git
cd codescan
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Scanning files in  your current directory

```bash
codescanai --provider openai
```
OR if you're cloning the repository,
```bash
python3 -m core.runner --provider openai
```

#### Scanning with a Custom AI Server

To scan code using a custom AI server:

```bash
codescanai --provider custom --host <http://localhost> --port <5000> --token <your_token> --directory <path/to/your/code>
```

### Supported arguments

| name           | description                                               | required | default        |

| `host`         | <p>Custom AI server host</p>                              | `false`  | `""`           |
| `port`         | <p>Custom AI server port</p>                              | `false`  | `""`           |
| `token`        | <p>Token for authenticating with the custom AI server</p> | `false`  | `""`           |
| `endpoint`     | <p>API endpoint for the custom server</p>                 | `false`  | `/api/v1/scan` |

### Limitations

- **Large number of files:** We currently do not support scalable way to scan a large number of files on a single run. Depending on the capacity of your AI Provider, you might run into a `rate_limit_exceeded` error. To do this, you can create a custom solution that breaks down the number of files for each run. 

## Future Work

- **Batch Processing:** For the limitation above, a future version will be to implement batch processing for a large number of files.

- **Caching Implementation:** A caching mechanism to store results of previously scanned files, reducing the number of API calls and optimizing performance.

- **Expanded Git Provider Support:** The tool is currently integrated with GitHub for PR-based scanning, future plans include extending support to other Git providers like GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure Repos.

- **Expanded Development tools:** This will be a plan to expand this tool to be accessible in other development environments. For example, as a VSCode extension.
